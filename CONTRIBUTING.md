# Contributing to CybGPT
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Why Contribute?
As a contributor to CybGPT, you're engaging in more than just coding; you're actively participating in the evolution of cybersecurity. Your expertise and contributions are vital in developing a tool that equips users with the knowledge and capabilities to understand and defend against digital threats. Through our collaborative efforts, we're committed to building a more secure and resilient cyber environment. We welcome your contributions and look forward to working together in this endeavor.

## Proposing new features
We highly value your contributions to this project. If you have innovative ideas for enhancing the capabilities of our cybersecurity assistant, we encourage you to get involved. You can contribute in the following ways:

- Adding New Features: You can contribute by adding new functionalities to our existing controllers. Feel free to explore the codebase and suggest new features that can improve the assistant's performance.
- Creating New Controllers: If you have specific ideas that require entirely new functionalities or unique characteristics, consider creating new controllers within the project. These controllers can bring diverse capabilities to the assistant.
- `open_api_schema.json`: Whenever you add new features or controllers, make sure to update the `open_api_schema.json` file to reflect the changes accurately. This file serves as the reference for the assistant's API schema.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Coinnect-SA/CybGPT/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Coinnect-SA/CybGPT/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We maintain a consistent and clean codebase by adhering to the [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) coding style. Standard JS is a set of JavaScript coding standards and best practices that help ensure code readability and maintainability.

Before contributing to this project, please make sure to:

1. Familiarize yourself with the [Standard JS rules](https://standardjs.com/rules.html).

2. Use a code editor or IDE that supports automatic linting and formatting using Standard JS rules.
