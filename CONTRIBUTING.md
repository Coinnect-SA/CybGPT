# Contributing to CybGPT
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your code changes and/or new functions
2. Make sure your code lints.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Coinnect-SA/CybGPT/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Coinnect-SA/CybGPT/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We maintain a consistent and clean codebase by adhering to the [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) coding style. Standard JS is a set of JavaScript coding standards and best practices that help ensure code readability and maintainability.

Before contributing to this project, please make sure to:

1. Familiarize yourself with the [Standard JS rules](https://standardjs.com/rules.html).

2. Use a code editor or IDE that supports automatic linting and formatting using Standard JS rules.
